Hi! I'm Anuradha. Former chemical engineer switching into a career focused on driving business decisions and strategy with data. My biggest accomplishment was directing the implementation to consolidate 7 large complex datasets into 1 relational database with SQL, Python, Excel and PowerBI while leading and uniting a cross functional remote data team to save $800K as a Senior Data Analyst, Product Operations.
* Agile project management with Jira
* Database schema and ERD with Miro
* Querying data with SQL
* Translating business requirements into technical specs
* Developing dashboards with PowerBI and Tableau

🌱 I most recently finished the Boston Housing and Salary Analysis project.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects working with ocean datasets, more specifically whale datasets, using Python and SQL!

⚡ Fun fact: I am an ocean activist, and have dedicated my profile picture to my favorite animal, and the apex predator of the ocean: the orca!
