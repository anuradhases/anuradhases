Hi! I'm Anuradha. Former chemical engineer switching into data. Led and implemented an initiative to consolidate 7 databases into one with SQL, Python, Excel and PowerBI as a Senior Data Analyst.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Property Analysis project using PostgreSQL, Snowflake and Tableau.

ðŸŒ± I most recently finished the Analyze Data with Python course on Codecademy.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects working with ocean datasets, more specifically whale datasets, using Python and SQL!

âš¡ Fun fact: I am an ocean activist, and have dedicated my profile picture to my favorite animal, and the apex predator of the ocean: the orca!
